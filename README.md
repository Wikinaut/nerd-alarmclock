nerd-alarmclock
===============

A Pi-Zero W based alarm-clock for nerds with many unique functions:

 - wake-up light (using Pimoroni's *Blinkt!*)
 - clock display (using Pimoroni's *Four Letter pHat*)
 - play sounds or internet radio using bluetooth
 - uses a chat-bot for configuration

Currently, this project is in the planning phase and no code is available.
So stay tuned!
