Keyboard Control
================

The keyboard has four keys. Each key has two of functions, a default
function and an overloaded function.

To switch between the default function and the overloaded function,
the button `4` has to be pressed long (about a second should do).


Default Functions
-----------------

Each of the buttons toggles the state of respective alarm, e.g. button `1`
controls `alarm1`:


| old state | new state |
|-----------|-----------|
| disabled  | enabled   |
| enabled   | disabled  |
| ringing   | enabled   |


Overloaded Functions
--------------------

A long press of button `4` activates the overloaded functions. After some
time of inactivity, the default functions are active again.

| Button | function                 |
|--------|--------------------------|
| `1`    | cycle display brightness |
| `2`    | cycle display modes      |
| `3`    | cycle LED brightness     |
| `4`    | cycle LED modes          |
